# Commodore-VIC-20-Super-Expander-II
This is a reverse engineered  Commodore Super Expander cartridge which does not have the original ROM pinouts, but fits 27C512 EPROMs. The 8k memory bank and the other configuration can be  selected with jumpers or solder bridges.

This cartridge provides a 3k RAM expansion (required for Super Expander) and up to two EPROMs and is of general use for games and especially the VIC-20 diagnostic software.

# Rev. 1

Rev. 1 allows to select a software size of 4k and 8k. This allows to combine the super expander software with a cartridge that resides at $B000. This requires a multi cartridge box (like the VC-1020). It is for 100% compatibility to teh original. Also a new logo was introduced.
